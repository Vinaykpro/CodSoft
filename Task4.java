        String[] answersWithExplanations = {
            "Correct Answer:B) A programming language\nExplanation: Java is a widely-used programming language known for its platform independence and versatility.",
            "Correct Answer:A) main()\nExplanation: The main() method is the entry point for any Java program. It's the first method that gets executed when the program is run.",
            "Correct Answer:B) final\nExplanation: The final keyword is used to declare a constant variable in Java, which means its value cannot be changed after it is assigned.",
            "Correct Answer:C) int\nExplanation: The int data type is used to store whole numbers (integers) in Java.",
            "Correct Answer:D) To make decisions in the code\nExplanation: The 'if' statement is used for conditional branching, allowing you to execute certain code blocks based on the evaluation of a condition.",
            "Correct Answer:B) Classes\nExplanation: In Java, objects are created from classes. A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects with similar properties and behaviors.",
            "Correct Answer:C) Reusing properties and behaviors of an existing class\nExplanation: Inheritance in Java allows a class (subclass or derived class) to inherit the properties and methods of another class (superclass or base class).",
            "Correct Answer:A) for loop\nExplanation: The 'for' loop is used when the number of iterations is known in advance. It provides a clear and concise way to control the loop's execution.",
            "Correct Answer:D) A runtime environment for executing Java code\nExplanation: The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is responsible for executing Java bytecode and providing a platform-independent runtime environment for Java programs.",
            "Correct Answer:D) constructor()\nExplanation: The 'constructor' method is called when an object of a class is created. It initializes the object's properties and performs any necessary setup.\n\n"
